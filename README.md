# Tip calculator - TypeScript

This project was a study about different ways to create the same project. This was made using **TypeScript**, but you can switch between branches and view the **Vue.js 2** and **VanillaJS** version. All versions was made using **Jest** and **Cypress**.

The idea behind this version is to use **TypeScript**, with **Cypress** and **Jest**.

This is the **VanillaJS** version with **TypeScript** so all configurations was made by me, including the **Webpack** and **Babel** to work with TypeScrip.
