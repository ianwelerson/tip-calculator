# Tip calculator - Vanilla JavaScript

This project was a study about different ways to create the same project. This was made using **pure JavaScript**, but you can switch between branches and view the **Vue.js 2** and **TypeScrip** version. All versions was made using **Jest** and **Cypress**.

The idea behind this version is to use **pure JavaScript**, with **Cypress** and **Jest**.

Beside that, in this version **all dependencies configurations was made by me**, including **Webpack**, **Babel**, **SASS** and more.

### Built with

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/)
